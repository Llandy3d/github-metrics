# rust-metrics

This is an experimental project to start gathering metrics about github organizations and repositories.

The goal is to get an idea of various "open source health" style metrics, such as:

* which repositories are the most active?
* who is contributing to them?
* how long does it take to get reviews?

Ultiamtely, I'd like to use this data to help projects and contributors be more successful. For example, it'd be nice to know if someone has stopped opening PRs in the last month or two -- maybe there is something blocking them that can be fixed?
