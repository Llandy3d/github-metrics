# üëãüèΩ Welcome!

This is an experimental project to start gathering metrics about github organizations and repositories.

The goal is to get an idea of various "open source health" style metrics, such as:

* which repositories are the most active?
* who is contributing to them?
* how long does it take to get reviews?

Ultimately, I'd like to use this data to help projects and contributors be more successful. For example, it'd be nice to know if someone has stopped opening PRs in the last month or two -- maybe there is something blocking them that can be fixed?

## Want to help?

Great! This is a fun project to hack on because it's relatively simple. It's a good way to get acquainted with async Rust and Rust in general. I'm eager to grow a set of maintainers who can help the project grow and be useful, so if you think it sounds appealing, get in touch with nikomatsakis on the [github-metrics zulip] instance below.
